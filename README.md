# Minesweeper
This is a Minesweeper game I wrote in Python as a project for one of my classes during my first year. It is a fully working Minesweeper
game using ASCII characters and coordinates in order to specifiy what the user wants to happen and where. 

The project consists of a file specifying the class "Minesweeper" which processes user input and displays the board, and the driver file
which creates the Minesweeper object and determines whether to run the game agin.

The maximum number of bombs that can be placed on the board is length * height - 1, as the first move by the player will never be a bomb.
